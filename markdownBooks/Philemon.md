# Philemon

## Ch 1.

Phm 1:1 - Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,    To Philemon our beloved fellow worker ^1-1

Phm 1:2 - and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house: ^1-2

Phm 1:3 - Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^1-3

Phm 1:4 - I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, ^1-4

Phm 1:5 - because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, ^1-5

Phm 1:6 - and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. ^1-6

Phm 1:7 - For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. ^1-7

Phm 1:8 - Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, ^1-8

Phm 1:9 - yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus— ^1-9

Phm 1:10 - I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. ^1-10

Phm 1:11 - (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) ^1-11

Phm 1:12 - I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. ^1-12

Phm 1:13 - I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, ^1-13

Phm 1:14 - but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord. ^1-14

Phm 1:15 - For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, ^1-15

Phm 1:16 - no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. ^1-16

Phm 1:17 - So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. ^1-17

Phm 1:18 - If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. ^1-18

Phm 1:19 - I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. ^1-19

Phm 1:20 - Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. ^1-20

Phm 1:21 - Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. ^1-21

Phm 1:22 - At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you. ^1-22

Phm 1:23 - Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, ^1-23

Phm 1:24 - and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. ^1-24

Phm 1:25 - The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. ^1-25
